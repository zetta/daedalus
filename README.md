API to calculate shortest driving path and estimated driving time to visit all specified locations, starting from the first in the list.

### Installation

```
# initialize the containers
docker-compose up --build  -d

# install dependencies into the volume
docker-compose run composer install
```
*Currently the containers will bind ports `80` and `3306` to the localhost.*

### Testing

To run the test we can simply call

```
docker-compose run composer test
```

### Considerations.

This project has indeed some improvement opportunities – mostly to have increased flexibility in the future – however they have been purposely omited in order to keep reduced complexity.
 - There is no `Object` representation of the `route` `entity`.
 - To present the `route` in the second endpoint a `Decorator` pattern could be used, however right now can be easily handled in the `RouteService`.
 - It was considered to use a `queue` system such as `RabbitMQ` to process all the `in progress` routes, however it will require a new container and also the consumer requires to be supervised which will require much more code maintenance. Right now the `async` capacity is handled by a background process fired everytime a new route is inserted.

### Directory

The project contains this directory hierarchy

```
- api
   |- bin
       |- console    # this is the main file for command line tasks, in this case processing a route in the background
   |- src
       |- Catalog
       |- Delegator
       |- Exception
       |- Services
       |- Traits
       |- Validator
       |- app.php            # dependency injection
       |- console.php        # command line definition
       |- controllers.php    # route definition
   |- tests          # unit testing
   |- web            # root directory for nginx application
```

### HTTP endpoints:

- [POST `/route`: Submit start point and drop-off locations](#submit-start-point-and-drop-off-locations)
- [GET `/route/<TOKEN>`: Get shortest driving route](#get-shortest-driving-route)

### Submit start point and drop-off locations

Method:
 - `POST`

URL path:
 - `/route`

Input body:

```json
[
  ["ROUTE_START_LATITUDE", "ROUTE_START_LONGITUDE"],
  ["DROPOFF_LATITUDE_#1", "DROPOFF_LONGITUDE_#1"],
  ...
]
```

Response body:
 - `HTTP code 200`

```json
{ "token": "TOKEN" }
```

or

```json
{ "error": "ERROR_DESCRIPTION" }
```

---

Input body example:

```json
[
  ["22.372081", "114.107877"],
  ["22.284419", "114.159510"],
  ["22.326442", "114.167811"]
]
```

Response example:

```json
{ "token": "9d3503e0-7236-4e47-a62f-8b01b5646c16" }
```

### Get shortest driving route
Get the shortest driving route for a given location (sequence of `[lat, lon]` values starting from start location resulting in shortest path).

Method:
- `GET`

URL path:
- `/route/<TOKEN>`

Response body:
- HTTP 200

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "path": [
    ["ROUTE_START_LATITUDE", "ROUTE_START_LONGITUDE"],
    ["DROPOFF_LATITUDE_#1", "DROPOFF_LONGITUDE_#1"],
    ...
  ],
  "total_distance": DRIVING_DISTANCE_IN_METERS,
  "total_time": ESTIMATED_DRIVING_TIME_IN_SECONDS
}
```
or

```json
{
  "status": "in progress"
}
```
or

```json
{
  "status": "failure",
  "error": "ERROR_DESCRIPTION"
}
```

---

URL example:
 - `/route/9d3503e0-7236-4e47-a62f-8b01b5646c16`

Response example:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "path": [
    ["22.372081", "114.107877"],
    ["22.326442", "114.167811"],
    ["22.284419", "114.159510"]
  ],
  "total_distance": 20000,
  "total_time": 1800
}
```
